Hi there! My name is Kerem. I am a Technical University of Berlin class of 2020 undergraduate majoring in Computer Science. I am currently working as a researcher at Remote Sensing and Image Analysis Group at TU Berlin, where I wrote my Bachelor's Thesis on "Collaborative Learning Models for Classification of Remote Sensing Images with Noisy Labels". We made a journal paper out of my thesis, check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10715).
